# Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles that I use on my Thinkpad T420 and now starting to use on my 2020 M1 Mac Mini.
They are sorted into folders based on application.

Some of them are grouped together according to function.
For example: i3 contains i3blocks as well, as they are closely linked.

## Usage

After cloning the repo the configurations can be applied individually using stow from within the repo folder.

```bash
stow PACKAGE
```

For example:

```bash
stow i3
```
